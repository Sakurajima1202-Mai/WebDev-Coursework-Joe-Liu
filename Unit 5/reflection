In unit 5, I mainly learned how to create and run CSS files. Objectively speaking, this class is somewhat difficult for me. 
I not only have to understand the concepts of external CSS and Internal CSS, but also change my code as required. This is a huge challenge.
I was faced with many logical problems among them. For example, I couldn't uniformly change the font size and format in the head part.
Fortunately, after continuous modifications in the end, I still completed the creation of the file
