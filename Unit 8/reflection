I think I've learn lots of things in Unit 8.
In this lesson, I specifically learned the usage of <div>, which can make my interface more attractive and beautiful.
Having learned more uses of div and understood the usage of "box", which can be either static or dynamic, now I know where the advertisements on websites come from. 
Making a table is relatively difficult. I need to list different parameters to ensure the generated style, which is a big challenge for me. 
Of course, the effect is also very obvious. In addition, I know how to build a header file in css document, and using it in HTML
