It should be said that during this learning process of 11 units, I have learned a lot. 
I have learned a lot of basic knowledge about implementing website design. 
I think this knowledge is very important to me and has transformed me from having no understanding of coding at all to being a beginner.
Such a transformation also makes me proud
