During the study of Unit 4, I learned the advanced usage of HTML. By learning HTML lists, I mastered how to organize the content more systematically. 
Both unordered lists and ordered lists use them at times. The environment for adding pictures is relatively difficult. 
At first, I didn't know how to successfully add pictures, but after continuous attempts, I still managed to insert pictures successfully. 
I have learned to enhance user experience and inclusiveness by using alt attributes and other methods.
This unit strengthened my understanding of web design and made me realize that websites are supposed to serve users and should be easy to understand
