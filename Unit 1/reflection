From Unit 1, I learn the basic knowledge of internet and also the building of websites, such as the history of websites and how people developed them. After
learning the basic information of backgroud of the web, I started to learn about the basic structure of the HTML documents. For example, I knew how to use 
the code like <title> <head> to build a web, which is a really interesting experience for me. As the practice went deeper, I also became familiar with other 
important tags, such as <h1>, <p>, and <a>, which helped me organize the content and add links between pages. I'm very glad to continue my studies and create 
meaningful web projects in the future.
