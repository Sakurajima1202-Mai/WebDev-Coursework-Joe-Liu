    <h1 title="Protecting Water=Protecting the Earth">Saving Water!</h1>
    <p><i>Protecting water</i> resources is everyone's responsibility. Saving water starts with me.
         Let's build a green, environmentally friendly and beautiful homeland together!</u>.
    </p>

    <p><mark>Why water is so <span style="color:red;font-style: italic;">important</span>:</mark></p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>It is very important for human beings</em></li>
        <hr>
        <li><em>It is also very important for other creatures</em></li>
        <hr>
        <li><em>It should be the <span style="color:red;font-style: italic;"> most important thing</span> in the world</em></li>
        <hr>
    </ul>

    <p>The water source is <u>limited and the circulation</u> is difficult. 
        It has to go through countless hardships to reach every drop of water in our lives.</p>

    <p><mark>What can we <span style="color:red; font-style:italic;">do</span> to make some changes on that:</mark></p>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Don't waste water resources.</em></li>
        <hr>
        <li><em>Recycle water</em></li>
        <hr>
        <li><em>Actively promote in society</em></li>
        <hr>
    </ol>

    <p>A drop of clear water, 
     a thousand precious things, has endured wind and rain and purification before merging into our lives.
