In this chapter, I have learned a lot about how to implement my ideas on the website. 
I understand that I need to first determine what content I want to express, and then put it in the completed HTML structure. 
I have also learned how to express the style and atmosphere of the website through colors, fonts and pictures, making it more in line with my personality and goals. 
For instance, choosing an appropriate color scheme can not only enhance the visual effect but also convey emotions and attitudes.
