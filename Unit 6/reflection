In this unit, I learned how to make my website better for everyone to use. I now understand more about user-centered design,
which means thinking about what people need when they use a website.
I focused on making the site easy to use, with clear information and simple navigation. 
After getting feedback from classmates and the client, I saw that good design is not just about how it looks, 
but also how well it works for different people.
